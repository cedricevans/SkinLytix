## Growth Framework

### North Star Metric

**Weekly Active Users (WAU) performing 1+ product analysis**

Why this metric?
- ✅ Directly measures core product usage
- ✅ Leading indicator of retention and engagement
- ✅ Correlates with revenue potential (future premium conversions)
- ✅ Reflects product value delivery

### Supporting Metrics

**Acquisition:**
- New user signups per week
- Conversion rate (visitor → signup)
- Organic vs. paid user split
- Referral rate (new users from referrals)

**Activation:**
- % users who complete profile onboarding
- % users who complete first analysis within 24h
- Time to first analysis

**Engagement:**
- Analyses per active user per week
- Routines created per user
- Optimization requests per routine
- Feedback submission rate

**Retention:**
- Day 1, Day 7, Day 30 retention rates
- Weekly retention cohorts
- Churn rate
- Resurrection rate (reactivated users)

**Revenue (Future):**
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- Freemium conversion rate
- Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)
- Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

---

### Growth Model

**Viral Loop Design:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Analyzes Product] --> B[Gets Personalized Result]
    B --> C{Result is Valuable?}
    C -->|Yes| D[User Shares on Social]
    C -->|Yes| E[User Tells Friends]
    D --> F[New Users Sign Up]
    E --> F
    F --> A
    
    B --> G[User Creates Routine]
    G --> H[Shares Routine Publicly]
    H --> F
```

**Target Viral Coefficient: 0.3+** (Each user brings 0.3 new users)

**Formula:**
```
Viral Coefficient (K) = Invitation Rate × Conversion Rate
Target: 50% share × 60% conversion = 0.3
```

If K = 0.3:
- 1,000 users → 300 new users → 90 more → 27 more = 1,417 total
- Exponential growth over multiple cycles

## Risk Management

### Growth Risks

**Risk 1: User Acquisition Slows**
- **Mitigation:** Diversify channels, optimize conversion funnels, increase referral incentives
- **Contingency:** Pivot to B2B focus (brands + retailers), reduce burn rate

**Risk 2: Competitor Copies Product**
- **Mitigation:** Build defensible moats (data network effects, community, brand trust)
- **Contingency:** Double down on unique features (routine optimization, AI recommendations)

**Risk 3: Freemium Conversion Underperforms**
- **Mitigation:** A/B test pricing, add more premium value, optimize paywall triggers
- **Contingency:** Explore alternative revenue (ads, affiliate, enterprise)

---

### Technical Risks

**Risk 1: Database Performance Degrades**
- **Mitigation:** Proactive monitoring, query optimization, read replicas, caching
- **Contingency:** Migrate to dedicated database cluster

**Risk 2: AI Costs Exceed Budget**
- **Mitigation:** Optimize prompts, cache results, use cheaper models for simple tasks
- **Contingency:** Build rule-based analysis for common cases, reduce AI usage

**Risk 3: App Store Rejection or Removal**
- **Mitigation:** Follow platform guidelines strictly, have legal review
- **Contingency:** Web-first strategy, Progressive Web App (PWA)

---

### Market Risks

**Risk 1: Regulatory Changes (FDA, GDPR)**
- **Mitigation:** Legal counsel, clear disclaimers, GDPR compliance
